# Day 5: The Beginning of the Library

Having managed to figure out how to use javascript to turn off a light yesterday,
today I decided that I would start to build a small library (or at least,
collection of functions), to make controlling a light from a program somewhat
straightforward.

Naturally, this requires a lot of documentation - so I spent the couple of hours
of time I had today rewriting my API document to make it more formal and
comprehensive, adding it to a new git repo, adding yesterday's js script to the
repo, and writing the blog post to cover the last four days. Followed by this
one. Considering that it's now 10pm and I need to be far more awake than I am now
to write a js library, I'm going to stop for the night. Following blog posts will
likely be far more comprehensive than these two, as I'll probably write them as I
write and test the library.
